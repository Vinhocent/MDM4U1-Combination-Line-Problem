Based on a homework question from MDM4U1:

If ten points lie on a line, and seven points lie on another parallel line, how many triangles can be formed by choosing three of these points?

Rewritten:
If x points lie on a line, and y points lie on another parallel line, how many triangles can be formed by choosing three of these points?

-Need to set parameters to if x and y are less than 2 (negative numbers for nCr function)
